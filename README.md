### Why are we doing it?
We are running a chapter (club) at our college. We organize 20+ events for our 1500+ participants. It was a tedious process to manually make forms, certificates, advertising via mail so we decided to automate that process. Any organization, clubs or institutions looking for a similar service can fork our project and tweak it according to their needs.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
What things you need to run the software:
- A **web server** preferably Apache2 with **PHP**.
- A **MySQL Database Server**. (Done and tested on 10.4.8-MariaDB)

### Installation
- Import the Sample CMS Database dump for **MariaDB** from [here](/docs/files/Sample_CMS_Database.sql) 
  - ```
      Default Username: admin
      Default Password: admin
    ```
  - Contains no other data other than the default user above.
- Copy the files from this repository to a location in the root directory of the web server. 


## Features

### Certificate Distribution System (CDS)

A two-ended system (Both for **admin** and **public**) that'll automatically  generate certificates and make them available for distribution. The admin will have to upload a **Certificate Template** and a **CSV file** with Participant Names, Position Awarded, and Event Name. The generated certificates would be later automatically made for distribution.
