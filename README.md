### Why are we doing it?
We are running a chapter (club) at our college. We organize 20+ events for our 1500+ participants. It was a tedious process to manually make forms, certificates, advertising via mail so we decided to automate that process. Any organization, clubs or institutions looking for a similar service can fork our project and tweak it according to their needs.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
What things you need to run the software:
- A web server preferably Apache2 with PHP.
- A MySQL Database Server. (Done and tested on 10.4.8-MariaDB)



## Features

### Certificate Distribution System (CDS)

**[WIP]** A system that'll automatically  generate certificates and make them available for distribution. The admin will have to upload a **Certificate Template** and a **CSV file** with Participant Names, Position Awarded, and Event Name. The generated certificates would be later automatically made for distribution.



## Screenshot

```bash
Tested on Apache/2.4.41 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1c PHP/7.3.11 with 10.4.8-MariaDB
```
